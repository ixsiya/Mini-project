    <p>Mr Raven was perched upon a limb,</p>
    <p>and Reynard the Fox looked up at him;</p>
    <p>For the Raven held in his great big beak</p>
    <p>A morsel the fox would go far to seek.</p>
    

    <p>Said the fox, in admiring tones:'My word!
    <p>Raven, you are a handsome bird'</p>
    <p>Such feathers! if you would only sing,</p>
    <p>The birds of these woods would call you king.'</p>

    <p>The Raven,who did not see the joke,
    <p> Forgot that his voice was just a croak.</p>
    <p>He opened his beak,in his foolish pride-</p>
    <p>And down fell the morsel the Fox had spied.</p>
    

    <p>'Ha-ha!' said the Fox.'And now you see
    <p>You should never listen to flattery.</p>
    <p>Vanity,Sir is a horrid vice-</p>
    <p>I'm sure the lesson is whorth the price.'</p>
